pattern-keyboard
================

 The machine knitted jacquard patterns become a textile keyboard which can interacte with a digital device. Connected with a MaKeyMaKey the knitted pattern becomes a  way of experimenting with sound, videos, games etc...   The 3 patterns are x2 outputs and x1 ground. The left hand has to touch the pattern connected to the ground and with the right hand you can touch either of the patterns connected to the output. To programme the pattern keyboard you can use  a Python script or Scratch.  Material:  Acrylic &amp; conductive yarn  Sources: www.makeymakey.com
